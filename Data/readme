Data S1. Mean annual increment (MAI) of diameter at breast height (DBH).

Data S2. Matrix of physical distances (measured in meters) between sampling positions (number of SNVs).

Data S3. Summary of the sequencing reads of S. laevis and S.leprosula genomes.

Data S4. The number of candidate SNVs during each step of the filtering process.

Data S5. Confirmation of SNVs using amplicon sequencing.
True SNVs were 91.7% in S1 and 100% in S2.

Data S6. Cosine similarity of mutation spectra between Shorea trees and human cancers.

Data S7. The final set of SNVs.

Data S8. Fractions of synonymous, missense, and nonsense substitutions.
The cds used to construct the matrix was determined by using the sequences of all isoforms (A) or primary isoform with the longest CDS for each gene (B).

Data S9. List of genes with somatic SNVs.
